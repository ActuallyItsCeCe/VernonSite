                    <p class="lead">"So in March of 2009 I lost my job. I was unemployed with a family of 4 to feed and in poor physical condition because I had been traveling so much over the past 3 years. I was 280 and had no direction in life. That June, I was looking to get my son into another sport. He did not like soccer and wanted to try something else. I went through the list, football, baseball, basketball and so on. He was not taking any interest until we got to karate. We went to the 1st of 2 local places and we were not impressed. We were getting ready to go to the 2nd when a good friend said, come to judo with us. We went and my son had a blast. We were getting ready to leave and my sensei looked and me said “Hey big guy, where are you going?” My response was “Home class is over.” He said “Adult class is starting” I reluctantly went out and was immediately hooked. I started going to class every chance I got and my weight started dropping and my confidence went up. By the end of the year Iw as down 20lbs and I had a new job. My journey has taken me to places mentally and physically I thought were passed me and I look better at 37 than I did at 27"</p>
